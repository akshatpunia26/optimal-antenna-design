# Optimal Antenna Design Using ML Techniques

## Description

For electromagnetic design problems, various computation methods have been applied and have shown promising results. However, these algorithms often entail substantial computational expenses due to the demanding nature of electromagnetic simulations. As a consequence, direct application of these algorithms for optimization can result in extensive time requirements, sometimes spanning weeks. This drawback restricts their applicability within numerous real-world industrial scenarios. This project aims to address this limitation by exploring and implementing machine learning techniques. The objective is to facilitate simulation- optimized antenna design within a feasible timeframe. This will be achieved through the utilization of a simulated dataset, encompassing various samples with distinct design parameters while maintaining a consistent substrate material and thickness. The dataset will be generated via the electromagnetic simulator CST Microwave Studio.
